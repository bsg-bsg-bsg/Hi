## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Anti-Detection System**
```lua
-- Hooks AddLog to prevent exploit logging
AntiDetection.OriginalAddLog = ReplicatedStorage.Transactions.AddLog.OnClientInvoke
ReplicatedStorage.Transactions.AddLog.OnClientInvoke = function(...)
    local args = {...}
    if args[1] == "Exploit" then
        return -- Block exploit logs
    end
    return AntiDetection.OriginalAddLog(...)
end
```

### **Safe Remote Calling**
```lua
AntiDetection.SafeCall = function(func, ...)
    local success, result = pcall(func, ...)
    if not success then
        warn("Safe call failed:", result)
    end
    return success, result
end
```

### **Money Setting (Confirmed Working)**
```lua
-- Uses the exact remote found in game files
ReplicatedStorage.Transactions.ClientToServer.ASet:InvokeServer(amount)
```

- Property unlocking
- Wood duplication
- Teleportation
- Tool range/speed modifications

### **USE WITH CAUTION** ⚠️
- Admin tool spawning
- Vehicle spawning

- Rapid-fire exploits without delays
- Using exploits while being watched by admins

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with money setting and teleportation
2. **Use Delays**: Don't spam exploits rapidly
3. **Be Discrete**: Avoid using exploits when admins are present
4. **Test First**: Try exploits in private servers first
5. **Have Backup**: Keep multiple accounts in case of issues
